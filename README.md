## Recipe Helper
This is the working repository for my galvanize Data Science Immersive course capstone project.

### Motivation
When I want to cook something I've never made before, the first thing I do is look up a recipe. Most of the time, I type to name of the food into a search engine, and just like that I have recipes. Dozens, if not hundreds of recipes. Far more than I would care to read and compare. Of those, which ones are good? Which ones are the easiest to prepare? Which can I make with the ingredients I have on hand? I usually deal with this problem by skimming only the first few results, comparing what they have in common, how they are different, and settling on one arbitrarily. This is not a thorough or rigorous comparison and it adds extra work before I can get into the kitchen. This project takes an algorithmic approach to gain the same insights that a human might gain by comparing various recipes for the same food.

### Methodology (in progress)
I will use unsupervised learning methods (clustering, PCA) to gain information about the typicality of recipes and the variation of ingredients within a class.
