## Recipe Helper
This is the working repository for my galvanize Data Science Immersive capstone project.

### Motivation
When I want to cook something I've never made before, the first thing I do is look up a recipe. Most of the time, I type to name of the food into a search engine, and just like that I have recipes. Dozens, if not hundreds of recipes. Far more than I would care to read and compare. Of those, which ones are good? Which ones are the easiest to prepare? Which can I make with the ingredients I have on hand. I typically deal with this problem by skimming only the first few result, comparing what they have in common, and how they are different, and settling on one somewhat arbitrary. However, my comparison is not thorough when I only look at a few results, and it adds extra work before I can get into the kitchen. This project takes an algorithmic approach to gain the same insights that a human might gain by comparing various recipes for the same food.

### Methodology (in progress)
I will use unsupervised learning methods (clustering, PCA) to gain information about the typicality of recipes and the variation of ingredients within a class.
